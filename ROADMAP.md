We deeply appreciate and value the significance of Open Source projects. It is with great pleasure that we would like to share our admiration for your roadmap vision. Should you require additional ideas for areas in which we can contribute, we have prepared a selection that we believe will be of interest to you.

Our plans encompass the following projects:

## IGL Open Source effort:
* Support SparkSL CLI tools to utilize SparkSL shaders in RenderSessions.
* Develop new RenderSession examples.
* Add OpenXR Android project.

## IGL evolution:
* Implement Queries support.
* Develop a Synchronization primitives API (addressing dependencies between drawcalls, also known as framegraph).
* Enable asynchronous loading of resources.
* Provide a Multi-threading API.
* Enhance sRGB support.
* Finish MSAA (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing) support.
* Ensure consistent instrumentation coverage.
* Achieve consistent resource tracking coverage.


Furthermore, we would like to present some ideas for potential supporters:

## How you can help:

* Assist with new API porting, such as DirectX, WebGPU, or any preferred platform of your choice.
* Contribute to the creation of additional examples, elevating their quality and diversity.
* Explore fancy projects involving web-based tools and integration with IDEs.
* Collaborate on the development of an IGL command capture and playback system. Offer expertise in playback on varying backends, providing an added bonus to the functionality.

We firmly believe that by collaborating on these initiatives, we can collectively foster an environment of growth and advancement in the field of graphics development.

Thank you for considering our contributions and for the opportunity to be part of your vision.
